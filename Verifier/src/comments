Making scopes (after synvalid):
---------------------------
put each open bracket's line num in stack, when meet closing bracket, create scope from stack pop until until
the closing brackets line. create and save scope as temp scope. remove scope lines from scanned file put scope pointer where the open bracket was.
when meeting next closing bracket, repeat above steps, and set child-parent relations between new scope and temp scope.
repeat until end.
remaining lines are main scope (has no parent).



synvalid checks:
---------------
bracket matcher
curly bracket matcher (may end line)
semicolon (line end)


Parser:
----------
parser will make sure all types, names and assignments are valid (using regex) and logics.
when parsing:
parse all except methods, point to array that holds the methods to parse and parse them at end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
notes:

made changes to the way exceptions are created, specific message is sent to the super() constructor to
allow getting the error message via Throwable's getMessage() method.

changed the main file to be more compact - all tries are in the same clause, catches would be set by error
type (all "1" errors will be caught in one clause, all "2" in the second, etc).
